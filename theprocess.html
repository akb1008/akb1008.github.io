      	My goal throughout the jewelry making process was to make inexpensive, wearable jewelry with the help of recycable materials. I used materials such as different size safety pins, bendable wire, chains, beads, etc. The designs of the jewelry seen on this page all came from ideas I found off the internet. If there is one thing I learned through making jewelry, it's the virtue of patience. Projects like these can take a lot of work and time off your hands, but in the end it's all worth it. As an independent learner I was able to take away a lot of valuable knowledge for the future through this project. I believe the most important was time management and learning the virtue of patience. I was able to make a schedule with times suitable to me and get certain tasks done, as well as learn that patience is a virtue and even though it can be easy to get overwhelmed when jewelry making takes too long or doesn't go as planned, staying calm and focused is extremely important and a good skill to maintain. All throughout this project I hit a lot bumps in the road and not everything I did went according to plan. I wasnâ€™t able to make my goal of ten jewelry pieces because my project started to get too pricey and I wasn't able to stick to recycled products because they started to become too difficult to find the specific pieces I needed. Along the way I learned to pay attention to detail when ordering parts because during the project I forgot some materials online when I ordered them and had to stall my project and wait for them to arrive.</p>
